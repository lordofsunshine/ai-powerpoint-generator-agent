### EXE version file
- I have specially compiled this entire project into one .EXE file for you to download and use the program. I want to say that the unoptimized file weighed more than 500MB~, and when I optimized everything - ~35MB.
üí° You can download the program at the link: <link>

### Decorative elements

Each slide gets decorations:
- **Corner accents** - colored elements in slide corners
- **Side shapes** - geometric shapes for visual variety
- **Background elements** - subtle colored blocks for structuring
- **Color accents** - automatic highlighting of important elements
- **Minimalist lines** - thin decorative elements

*THE NEURAL NETWORK PLACES DECORATIONS AND POSITIONS THEM. THIS IS A BETA FEATURE AND IT MAY OVERUSE DECORATIONS. (but generally this is controlled)*

### Presentation settings

- **Title** - Main theme of the presentation
- **Language** - Russian or English
- **Number of sections** - Main sections (default: 1)
- **Slides per section** - Number of slides in each section (default: 4)

### How to change language?

- [x] The program has the ability to change language to **English** or **Russian**. Just send the number "5" in the main menu and select a new language. It is recommended to restart the program so that all changes take effect correctly.

### About the future of the project...
- Actually, this project is quite interesting for me and useful for you. Automatic presentation generation and automatic decoration - and this is done INSTEAD of you in a couple of minutes! (if there are not too many slides and sections). Even if you don't like something on the slide, you have the opportunity to edit or delete anything, or use our program function "Presentation Correction", give an AI prompt and it will try to fix it.
If you notice, other more popular presentation generation services have limits on slides, but in my program there are no limits. Generate even 1000 slides, just how much time it will take. And without any watermarks. Absolutely free and convenient.
I plan to continue developing this project and really hope for your support. Thank you! üìç
